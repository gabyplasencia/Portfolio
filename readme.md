#My first porfolio.

I made the [design in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/pylIog081kmNwqlwVIS2Sp/Portfolio?type=design&t=4oFNeZMfKxlGEGyi-6), I tried to follow basic UX/UI rules, such as keep a constant spacing, good contrast between the background and the letters and keep a clean but interesting design.

### My process

It is built with:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS:
  - Grid
  - Flexbox
  - Custom variables
  - Media Queries
- SASS:
  - Partials
  - Mixins
  - Sass variables
- Javascript:
  - No framework
  - GSAP

In this case I am not using a mobile first approach because I think I won't have to rewrite to much starting form desktop.

First I am making the general styles and I will leave the animations and transitions to the end.
